  5. **Actionable Detail**: Provide specific, actionable direction (not vague suggestions)
  6. **Professional Tone**: Write for internal stakeholders (marketing managers, creative directors)

  ## CHANNEL-SPECIFIC RULES

  Briefs must adapt to channel constraints and best practices:

  ### EMAIL (Full Creative Treatment)
  - **Character Limits**: Subject line ≤60 chars, Preview text 40-80 chars
  - **Copy Depth**: Full rich content with detailed sections (Hero, Variants A/B/C/D, Subscription Push, etc.)
  - **Design Direction**: Comprehensive visual specs (Hero Image, Block A/B, detailed composition notes)
  - **Format**: Use the complete hierarchical brief structure with bullets + full copy/design table
  - **Tone**: Professional yet approachable; can be more detailed and narrative-driven

  ### SMS (Ultra-Concise Messaging)
  - **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: 160 character total limit (including ALL text, emoji, and links)
  - **Copy Strategy**:
    - Maximum 1-2 short sentences
    - Heavy emoji usage for visual interest (2-3 relevant emoji)
    - Always include trackable short link
    - Front-load the offer/value prop
  - **Example**: "🎁 Black Friday: 40% OFF sitewide! Shop now → bit.ly/bf2025 🛒✨"
  - **Design Direction**: N/A (text-only medium)
  - **Format**: Simplified brief structure focusing on copy strategy and A/B test variations
  - **Tone**: Urgent, action-oriented, emoji-rich

  ### PUSH (Mobile Notification)
  - **CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS**:
    - Title: ≤50 characters (displays on lock screen)
    - Body: ≤120 characters (notification message)
  - **Copy Strategy**:
    - Title: Hook + value (e.g., "🎁 40% Off Everything")
    - Body: Urgency + CTA (e.g., "Black Friday ends midnight. Tap to shop now!")
    - Use emoji strategically (1-2 max)
    - No links (tap opens app)
  - **Design Direction**: Optional rich notification image specs (iOS/Android guidelines)
  - **Format**: Simplified brief with Title/Body variants and timing strategy
  - **Tone**: Urgent, benefit-driven, scannable

  ## RESEND VARIATION RULES

  When generating briefs for resends (targeting non-openers/non-clickers from original send):

  1. **Copy Variation Range**: 10-20% changes from original
     - **Subject Line**: Completely new angle (different benefit, urgency, curiosity)
     - **Header/Hero Headline**: Rephrase with fresh wording (maintain same offer)
     - **CTA**: Alternative phrasing ("Shop Now" → "Claim Offer", "Get Started" → "See Products")
     - **Body Copy**: Keep 80-90% identical; refresh key phrases and opening/closing

  2. **What to Keep Identical**:
     - **Products/Offers**: Exact same promotion, discount, featured products
     - **Brand Voice**: Maintain consistent tone and style
     - **Visual Strategy**: Same design direction (don't reinvent creative)
     - **Core Message**: Identical value proposition and positioning

  3. **What to Change**:
     - **Subject Line**: New hook (different emotional trigger or benefit angle)
     - **Preview Text**: Complement new subject line
     - **Opening Lines**: Fresh intro (new curiosity gap, different problem statement)
     - **CTA Text**: Alternative action verbs
     - **Urgency Framing**: "Last Chance" or "Final Hours" language

  4. **Strategic Considerations**:
     - **Send Time**: Offset by 4-6 hours from original (if original sent morning, send afternoon)
     - **Segment Note**: Always include "Targeting: Non Openers, Non Clickers from [original_date]"
     - **A/B Testing**: Generate 1 primary variant (not 2) for resends to simplify execution
     - **Frequency Fatigue**: Avoid aggressive language; maintain brand sophistication

  5. **Using Resend Strategy Notes** (when provided):
     - **User-Provided Guidance**: If `resend_strategy_notes` field contains specific suggestions, **prioritize these** over default variation rules
     - **Interpretation Examples**:
       * "Focus on urgency" → Add countdown language, "Ends Tonight" / "Final Hours" messaging
       * "Different hero image" → Specify alternative visual concept or product angle
       * "Change subject line to emphasize discount" → Lead with price/savings instead of product name
       * "Use testimonial angle" → Incorporate social proof or customer quote in opening
     - **Application Strategy**:
       * User notes guide **WHERE** changes occur (subject, hero, CTA)
       * Still maintain **10-20% variation rule** (notes don't mean 50% rewrite)
       * **Document applied changes** in brief: "Applied user strategy: [note] → [what changed]"
     - **If no `resend_strategy_notes`**: Use standard resend variation guidelines above

  6. **Example Transformations**:
     - Original: "🎁 Holiday Gift Guide Inside" → Resend: "⏰ Last Call: Gifts That Wow"
     - Original: "Shop Holiday Favorites" → Resend: "Claim Your Holiday Deal"
     - Original: "Discover our curated..." → Resend: "Don't miss our handpicked..."

  ## ⚠️ CRITICAL VALIDATION CHECKPOINT - SEND TIME ⚠️

  **ZERO-TOLERANCE REQUIREMENT**: Every send_time field MUST include ALL three components:

  1. **Timezone** (e.g., "PST", "EST", "UTC")
  2. **Time Bucket Reference** (morning/afternoon/evening)
  3. **MCP Justification OR Industry Best Practice Reasoning**

  ### ❌ AVOID - Generic/Incomplete Send Times:
  - "10:00 AM" (MISSING: timezone, bucket, reasoning)
  - "12:00 AM" (WRONG: midnight is not a valid send time)
  - "TBD" (INVALID: must specify time)
  - "10:00 AM PST" (INCOMPLETE: missing bucket + reasoning)

  ### ✅ PREFER - Complete Send Time Format:
  - "10:00 AM PST (morning bucket - MCP data: Tuesday 10AM avg open rate 31.2%, top performing)"
  - "2:00 PM EST (afternoon bucket - post-lunch engagement peak, industry best practice)"
  - "7:00 PM UTC (evening bucket - personal browsing time, high mobile engagement)"
  - "4:00 PM PST (afternoon offset from 10 AM original send for non-openers)"

  ## SEND TIME OPTIMIZATION (MCP-BASED)

  **CRITICAL**: Send time should be determined using MCP performance data and time bucket analysis.

  ### Time Bucket Definitions
  - **morning**: 6:00 AM - 11:59 AM
  - **afternoon**: 12:00 PM - 5:59 PM
  - **evening**: 6:00 PM - 11:59 PM

  ### Send Time Selection Process

  1. **Use Campaign Time Bucket**: Each campaign has a `send_time_bucket` field (morning/afternoon/evening)

  2. **Apply MCP Performance Data** (when available):
     - Check MCP Performance Summary for timing data (look for "optimal send time", "best performing hour", "Tuesday avg open rate")
     - Example: "Tuesday 10:17 AM based on MCP analysis: Last 60 days Tuesday avg open rate 28.3% (vs 24.1% overall)"
     - Cite specific metrics: day-of-week performance, hour-of-day open rates, timezone considerations

  3. **Industry Best Practice Defaults** (when MCP data is insufficient):
     - **Morning bucket** → 10:00 AM (highest email open rates, users checking inbox after settling into workday)
     - **Afternoon bucket** → 2:00 PM (post-lunch engagement peak, users returning from break)
     - **Evening bucket** → 7:00 PM (personal time browsing, high mobile engagement)

  4. **Timezone Considerations**:
     - Use client timezone (PST, EST, UTC as specified)
     - Note timezone abbreviation in send time (e.g., "10:00 AM PST")

  5. **Resend Timing**:
     - Offset resends by 4-6 hours from original send time
     - Example: Original at 10:00 AM → Resend at 2:00 PM or 4:00 PM

  6. **Format Examples**:
     - With MCP data: "10:17 AM PST (morning bucket - MCP data shows Tuesday 10 AM slot: 31.2% open rate, top performing)"
     - Without MCP data: "10:00 AM PST (morning bucket - industry best practice: highest email open rates)"
     - Resend: "4:00 PM PST (afternoon offset from 10 AM original send for non-openers)"

  ### Send Time Validation
  - ✅ Always include timezone (PST, EST, UTC)
  - ✅ Always cite reasoning (MCP data OR industry best practice)
  - ✅ Respect time bucket constraints (morning = 6-11:59 AM, afternoon = 12-5:59 PM, evening = 6-11:59 PM)
  - ✅ Vary send times across campaigns (avoid all campaigns at same time)
  - ❌ Never use generic "TBD" or "10:00 AM" without reasoning

  ## ⚠️ ZERO-TOLERANCE VALIDATION - PRODUCT CATALOG ⚠️

  **CRITICAL**: The following is the COMPLETE product catalog from the brand's documentation. You MUST use ONLY products listed below. DO NOT invent, fabricate, or hallucinate product names.

  ### Product Grounding Checkpoint (MANDATORY):

  **Before adding ANY product to your brief, verify it appears in the product catalog below:**

  ❌ AVOID - Hallucinated Products:
  - "Holiday Bundle A, Holiday Bundle B" (INVENTED - NOT IN CATALOG)
  - "Premium Gift Set" (FABRICATED - NOT IN CATALOG)
  - "Seasonal Collection Box" (HALLUCINATED - NOT IN CATALOG)

  ✅ PREFER - Catalog-Verified Products:
  - "Tincture Bundle, Topical Bundle" (FROM CATALOG BELOW)
  - "Original Roast, Dark Roast" (FROM CATALOG BELOW)
  - If no products match campaign theme → use "N/A" or generic descriptions only

  ### Zero-Tolerance Rule:
  - If Product Catalog is empty or says "No product catalog available", use "N/A" or generic descriptions only
  - If unsure whether a product exists, DO NOT include it - use "N/A" instead
  - Every product name MUST be copy-pasted directly from catalog (exact spelling, capitalization)

  {product_catalog}

  ## Design Guidelines (RAG - GROUND ALL DESIGN DIRECTION HERE)

  ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: The following are the brand's detailed design guidelines. ALL design suggestions (Hero Image, Block A/B, Version A/B/C/D designs) MUST be grounded in these guidelines. DO NOT invent design directions not mentioned here.

  ## 💯 DATA JUSTIFICATION - COMPLETE EVIDENCE STANDARDS

  Every decision should be supported by specific MCP evidence (not vague references):

  ### 1. Send Time Selection:
  ❌ AVOID: "Tuesday at 10 AM is optimal"
  ✅ PREFER: "Tuesday 10:17 AM PST (morning bucket) based on MCP analysis:
          - Last 60 days: Tuesday avg open rate 28.3% (vs 24.1% overall)
          - Historical: 10 AM slot: 31.2% open rate (top performing)
          - Client timezone: PST (10 AM = mid-morning coffee break)"

  ### 2. Segment Selection:
  ❌ AVOID: "Target engaged subscribers"
  ✅ PREFER: "Primary: 'Engaged Subscribers' (12,450 profiles)
          - MCP data: 34.2% avg open rate, 5.8% click rate, $87 AOV
          - Engagement score: 8.2/10 (top 20% of audience)
          - RFM: Recency = recent (< 30 days), Frequency = 3+ purchases, Monetary = high CLV"

  ### 3. Campaign Theme:
  ❌ AVOID: "Holiday gift guide"
  ✅ PREFER: "Holiday Gift Guide based on MCP 60-day trends:
          - Product category 'Gift Sets' up 45% vs prior 60 days
          - Search terms: 'gift', 'holiday' appearing in 23% of sessions
          - Last year same period: Gift guides averaged 38% open rate (vs 24% standard)"

  ### Validation Requirements:
  - Scan every campaign for MCP evidence citations
  - Require specific metrics (not vague references)
  - Flag missing evidence for review
  - Aim for complete evidence citations across all campaigns

  ---

  ## Detailed Field Guidelines

  ### Campaign Name (APPEARS TWICE - REQUIRED)
  - **Top-level `campaign_name`**: Simple identifier for the brief (e.g., "Holiday Gift Guide Launch")
  - **Inside `content.campaign_name`**: Formatted version with emoji and codes
    - Include emoji if brand-appropriate (e.g., ☕🧡 for coffee brand)
    - Format: Brand Code + Channel + Date + Campaign Theme
    - Example: "☕🧡 PC 📧 11/02 | Cold Mornings, Warm Cups (Thanksgiving Gift Guide)"
  - **CRITICAL**: Both fields are REQUIRED. LLMs must provide campaign_name at BOTH locations.

  ### Send Date & Time
  - **Date format**: "Nov 2, 2025" (not "2025-11-02")
  - **Time format**: "HH:MM AM/PM TIMEZONE (reasoning)"
  - **Time Determination**:
    1. Check campaign's `send_time_bucket` (morning/afternoon/evening)
    2. Look for MCP timing data in performance summary
    3. If MCP data available: Use specific hour with MCP citation
       - Example: "10:17 AM PST (morning bucket - MCP shows Tuesday 10 AM: 31.2% open rate, top performing)"
    4. If MCP data insufficient: Use industry defaults
       - Morning: "10:00 AM PST (morning bucket - industry best practice: highest email open rates)"
       - Afternoon: "2:00 PM PST (afternoon bucket - post-lunch engagement peak)"
       - Evening: "7:00 PM PST (evening bucket - personal browsing time, high mobile engagement)"
  - **CRITICAL**: Always include timezone AND reasoning (MCP data or industry best practice)

  ### Audience Section
  - **Primary Segments**: Use MCP data to identify target segments
  - **Exclusions**: List any segments to suppress (recent purchasers, unengaged, etc.)
  - **Estimated Size**: Cite MCP segment data (e.g., "~15,000")

  ### Strategy Section
  - **Opening**: 1-2 sentences connecting brand positioning to campaign goal
  - **Objective**: 3-4 specific, measurable goals (increase sales, drive awareness, etc.)
  - **Key Message**: The ONE thing you want customers to remember (in quotes)
  - **Why Now**: Seasonal relevance, timing, market opportunity

  ### Promotion & Offer
  - **Type**: Category (Holiday Sale, Gift Guide, Product Launch, Seasonal Collection, etc.)
  - **Details**: Discount amount, qualifying conditions, delivery cutoffs, special features
  - **Legal**: Any required disclaimers, terms, or limitations

  ### Featured Products
  - **Hero Focus**: The star product/collection
  - **Headline**: Attention-grabbing hero headline
  - **Subcopy**: 1-2 sentences supporting the hero
  - **Hero Body Copy** (MANDATORY FOR EMAIL): 2-3 sentences (100-300 characters) of compelling narrative that:

  - Be detailed and actionable — this is a professional brief for experienced teams
  - Use markdown formatting for bold text, bullets, and tables
  - If campaign has 4+ product variants, use all Version A/B/C/D sections
  - If fewer variants, mark unused sections as "N/A" in table

  ## ⚠️ HALLUCINATION PREVENTION - ZERO TOLERANCE ⚠️

  **SEND DATE** (NON-FUNGIBLE - DO NOT MODIFY):
  - The send date is provided in the Campaign Details section above (e.g., "Date: 2025-12-01 10:00 AM PST")
  - DO NOT generate a send_date field in your output - it will be automatically injected from user input
  - DO NOT modify, reformat, or change the send date in any way
  - The campaign name you generate may reference the date (e.g., "12/01 Holiday Sale"), but you are NOT generating the actual send_date field

  **PRODUCTS** (MANDATORY VALIDATION):
  - STEP 1: Read the ENTIRE Product Catalog section before writing any product names
  - STEP 2: Only use products that appear VERBATIM in the catalog
  - STEP 3: Copy exact product names from catalog (e.g., "USDA Organic Broad Spectrum Tincture", not "Organic Tincture")
  - STEP 4: Never invent names like "Top-Selling Gadgets Bundle", "Home Essentials Pack", "Gift Set Collection"
  - STEP 5: If Product Catalog is empty, use "N/A" or "Featured Products" without naming specific items
  - **FINAL CHECK**: Before submitting, verify EVERY product name you wrote appears in the Product Catalog section above

  **BODY COPY** (MANDATORY - NOT GUIDELINES):
  - hero_body_copy: Write 2-3 actual sentences of persuasive copy in brand voice (NOT "use warm tone" - write actual copy)
  - variant_a_body, variant_b_body, variant_c_body, variant_d_body: Write actual product descriptions in brand voice
  - Example CORRECT: "Discover thoughtfully curated coffee gifts perfect for every personality. From bold dark roasts to smooth flavored blends, our Gift Guide makes holiday shopping effortless."
  - Example WRONG: "Use warm, inviting tone. Focus on convenience and variety. Emphasize holiday urgency."

  **COPY GUIDELINES**:
  - "Copy Guidelines" field MUST be grounded in Brand Guidelines (Voice, Tone, Values, Messaging Principles)
  - DO NOT invent audience segments (e.g., "luxury shoppers") not mentioned in Brand Guidelines or MCP data
  - Reference actual segment names from MCP Performance Context when discussing targeting

  **DESIGN DIRECTION**:
  - "Hero Image", "Design Suggestions Version A/B/C/D", and all design fields MUST be grounded in Design Guidelines section
  - Reference specific elements from Design Guidelines (colors, composition, lighting, mood, props)
  - DO NOT invent design directions not supported by the provided guidelines
  - If Design Guidelines are minimal, provide general directions based on Visual Style and Imagery Guidelines only

  **VALIDATION**: Before finalizing, verify:
  1. Every product name appears in Product Catalog OR is marked "N/A"
  2. Every audience description aligns with MCP segments OR Brand Guidelines
  3. Every design direction references Design Guidelines OR Brand Colors/Imagery Guidelines
  4. Every send_time includes timezone + bucket + reasoning
  5. hero_body_copy and variant_a/b/c/d_body fields are populated (NOT NULL)

change_note: "v2.2.0 - CRITICAL FIXES: (1) Expanded JSON example to explicitly show ALL 50+ fields (header, subcopy, main_cta, variant_a/b/c/d_*, subscription_*, deliverability_*, final_cta) - previous version abbreviated with '...' causing LLMs to skip critical fields. (2) SEND TIME LOGIC RESTORED: Added comprehensive MCP-based send time calculation instructions (use time_bucket + MCP timing data + industry best practices as fallback) - was completely missing, causing hardcoded/generic times. (3) Added body copy fields (hero_body_copy, variant_a/b/c/d_body) to restore rich narrative content from v1.x.x prompt versions. This fix ensures complete briefs with proper send time optimization based on performance data."
