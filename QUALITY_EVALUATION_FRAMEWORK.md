# Calendar Output Quality Evaluation Framework

## Evaluation Criteria (Human-Level or Better)

### 1. Strategic Coherence (20 points)
- [ ] **Narrative Flow**: Does the calendar tell a cohesive story across the month?
- [ ] **Seasonal Relevance**: Campaigns aligned with seasonal themes (February = Valentine's, winter)?
- [ ] **Logical Progression**: Early awareness → Mid-month conversion → Late urgency?
- [ ] **Cross-Campaign Synergy**: Do campaigns build on each other?

**Human Benchmark**: A human strategist would create themed weeks, seasonal hooks, progressive intensity.

### 2. Campaign Creativity (20 points)
- [ ] **Unique Concepts**: Original ideas, not generic "New Product Launch #3"?
- [ ] **Compelling Subject Lines**: Curiosity, urgency, benefit-driven?  
- [ ] **Copy Quality**: Professional, brand-aligned, engaging?
- [ ] **Offer Variety**: Mix of discounts, education, exclusives, urgency?

**Human Benchmark**: Campaigns should feel crafted by a skilled copywriter, not templated.

### 3. Segment Intelligence (15 points)
- [ ] **Diversity**: Using 8+ different segments from MCP (not "All")?
- [ ] **Relevance**: Segments match campaign themes (VIP for exclusives, Lapsed for winback)?
- [ ] **Strategic Targeting**: Campaigns reach different audience slices?
- [ ] **No "All Subscriber" Overuse**: <10% of campaigns use broadcast?

**Human Benchmark**: A strategist would carefully match segments to offers.

### 4. Send Day Distribution (10 points)
- [ ] **Full Week Coverage**: All 7 days used (Mon-Sun)?
- [ ] **Balanced Distribution**: Max 3 per day?
- [ ] **Weekend Sends**: At least 1-2 weekend sends for lifestyle brand?
- [ ] **Historical Analysis**: Diversifies beyond last year's patterns?

**Human Benchmark**: Avoid clustering on Tue/Thu only - spread for inbox diversity.

### 5. Resend Campaigns (15 points)
- [ ] **Presence**: Resends created for promotional campaigns?
- [ ] **Timing**: 2-3 days after original?
- [ ] **Subject Variation**: Different angle (not just "RE:")?
- [ ] **Segment Accuracy**: "Non-Openers from [Original]"?
- [ ] **Revenue Calc**: 0.25x of original (smaller audience)?

**Human Benchmark**: Resends are standard practice for high-value offers.

### 6. Revenue Realism (10 points)
- [ ] **Varied Estimates**: Different revenue per campaign (not flat $5k)?
- [ ] **Metric-Based**: Calculated from real open%, click%, AOV?
- [ ] **Campaign Type Multipliers**: Educational lower than promotional?
- [ ] **Segment-Specific**: VIP segments higher revenue than lapsed?

**Human Benchmark**: Revenue projections should reflect campaign type and audience.

### 7. Performance Metrics (5 points)
- [ ] **Open Rates**: 20-40% range (not 0.3%)?
- [ ] **Click Rates**: 2-6% range (not 0.1%)?
- [ ] **Conversion Rates**: 1-5% range?
- [ ] **Percentages Formatted Correctly**: 30%, not 0.003?

**Human Benchmark**: Metrics should match industry norms for coffee/DTC brands.

### 8. User Instructions Adherence (5 points)
- [ ] **If Provided**: User instructions followed exactly?
- [ ] **Priority**: User requests override MCP/RAG conflicts?
- [ ] **Examples**: Valentine's focus, specific segments, flash sales honored?

**Human Benchmark**: A human would follow explicit client requests first.
